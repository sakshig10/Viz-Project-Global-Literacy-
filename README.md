# Global Literacy: Understanding the Power of Education

In this project you will find interactive, dynamic and engaging visualizations in R (Rshiny, Plotly), Flourish and Datawrapper. The story or the flow of these visualizations are all displayed in the form of a website as the outcome of the project. The website/webpage is created using Google Sites.
The title of the project is â€œGlobal Literacy".

We begin by examining the global conditions of literacy. What is the current state of literacy around the world? How has it evolved over time? We use dynamic visualizations to paint a comprehensive picture of literacy rates across different regions and countries. To gain a deeper understanding, we delve into the literacy landscape in the recent past. Our dynamic visualizations provide insights into the latest literacy statistics and trends.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive analysis of education and literacy worldwide. Key factors, such as literacy rates, government education spending, gender inequality, and their impact on development indexes, are explored. The analysis will help identify areas of progress and areas where improvement is needed to promote education and literacy as essential human rights.

## Data Source

The project utilizes data from various sources, including the Human Development Index Report of the United Nations Development Program, to gather information on literacy rates, government education spending, and other relevant indicators from
https://data.worldbank.org/

## Results

The project's analysis has yielded several key findings:

- The global illiteracy rate has significantly decreased over the past two centuries, from 88% to less than 14%.
- Literacy rates vary between regions, with some areas achieving rates above 80%, while others still struggle to reach that level.
- Gender inequality in literacy has reduced drastically in most countries, although some still have higher disparities.
- Government spending on education plays a crucial role in improving literacy rates. Countries with higher education spending tend to have higher literacy rates.
- Spending allocation on primary, secondary, and tertiary education varies among countries. For less literate countries, prioritizing primary education may be more effective.
- The literacy rate is positively correlated with the Human Capital Index but does not directly impact GDP growth or employment rates.

## Impact of Project Outcome

The project's findings have the potential to transform policies and initiatives aimed at promoting education and literacy on a global scale. By understanding the factors that influence literacy rates and their correlation with development indexes, governments and organizations can make informed decisions to bridge educational disparities and promote sustainable development.
