## Overview

Education and literacy are fundamental human rights and key drivers of sustainable development. However, millions of people worldwide still lack access to quality education and struggle with illiteracy. This project aims to analyze education and literacy worldwide, using various indicators, to identify trends and patterns. The analysis will help in understanding the current state of education and literacy globally, highlighting disparities and areas where improvements are needed to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4) - inclusive and equitable quality education for all.

## Problem Setting

Despite the importance of education and literacy, there are significant disparities in access and attainment around the world. Many factors contribute to the literacy rate, including government education spending, gender inequality, and regional differences. This project seeks to address these issues and provide insights into the current state of education and literacy on a global scale.

## Problem Definition

The primary goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive analysis of education and literacy worldwide. Key factors, such as literacy rates, government education spending, gender inequality, and their impact on development indexes, will be explored. The analysis will help identify areas of progress and areas where improvement is needed to promote education and literacy as essential human rights.

## Data Source

The project utilizes data from various sources, including the Human Development Index Report of the United Nations Development Program, to gather information on literacy rates, government education spending, and other relevant indicators.

## Tech Stack Used
R Interactive Libraries: Dynamic visualizations were created using R and interactive libraries such as Rshiny and Plotly to provide engaging and informative charts.

Flourish: Flourish was used to generate visually appealing and interactive visualizations, which were then embedded in the project website.

Datawrapper: Datawrapper was utilized to create data visualizations in HTML format, which were seamlessly integrated into the project website.

Google Sites: The project's story and visualizations were presented in the form of a website using Google Sites, providing an organized and accessible platform for the audience.

## Results

The project's analysis has yielded several key findings:

- The global illiteracy rate has significantly decreased over the past two centuries, from 88% to less than 14%.
- Literacy rates vary between regions, with some areas achieving rates above 80%, while others still struggle to reach that level.
- Gender inequality in literacy has reduced drastically in most countries, although some still have higher disparities.
- Government spending on education plays a crucial role in improving literacy rates. Countries with higher education spending tend to have higher literacy rates.
- Spending allocation on primary, secondary, and tertiary education varies among countries. For less literate countries, prioritizing primary education may be more effective.
- The literacy rate is positively correlated with the Human Capital Index but does not directly impact GDP growth or employment rates.

## Impact of Project Outcome

The project's findings have the potential to inform policies and initiatives aimed at promoting education and literacy on a global scale. By understanding the factors that influence literacy rates and the correlation with development indexes, governments and organizations can make informed decisions to bridge educational disparities and promote sustainable development.
